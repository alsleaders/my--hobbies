      <p class="first-ramble">
        I like reading a variety of things about any given topic as long as it
        has a good hook I don't care.
      </p>
      <p class="second-ramble">
        I think the real problem I have is I get so involved with fictional
        characters. Especially when those characters feel real, I feel like it
        is very easy to get overly invested in them.
