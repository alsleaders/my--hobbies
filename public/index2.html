    <h1 class="hello-world">Another one of my hobbies is PUPPIES</h1>
    <p class="dog-rant">
      I also have dogs and they make is so I have to vacuum up a lot of fur but
      only one of them likes the vacuum.<br />
      <br />

      So I sweep. <br />
      <br />
      And then I vacuum. And then one of the dogs runs to the other end of the
      house.

      But the nice thing is this way I don't have little blonde tumbleweeds
      rolling down my hallway.
    </p>
    <br />
    I have two dogs
    <br />
